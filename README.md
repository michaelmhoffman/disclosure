# Michael M. Hoffman's disclosures

Potential competing interests.

## Philosophy

When disclosing competing interests, it is the duty of a researcher to point out those competing interests most likely to affect the accompanying work.
Extensive listings can actually increase the difficulty of detecting the most relevant competing interests.
When submitting disclosures to an organization with guidelines for disclosing competing interests, I follow those guidelines.
In the absence of such guidelines, I use my own judgment as to which competing interests have the most relevance.
For full transparency, I also provide a full list of potential competing interests in this Git repository.

Categories in this document come from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest.
Following ICMJE recommendations, I list potential conflicts for at least 36 months after the relevant relationships conclude.
Using a Git repository for the disclosure enables later examination of since-removed conflicts and therefore fuller disclosure.

### Travel expenses

Travel expense reimbursements and honoraria since 2020-01-01.
I would like to disclose earlier expense reimbursements but it will be difficult to ensure an accurate, exhaustive list for the last 36 months.
Until I can do so, I will keep notes in this comment.

### Investments

I do not have any investments in individual businesses.
All my individual investments are in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.
These funds have broad investment strategies focusing on asset class (stocks or debt), groups of countries (for example, investments in the United States, or investments outside North America) and market capitalization divisions (for example small-cap, mid-cap, or large-cap).
None of these funds focus on particular market sectors or industries.

I also hold a pension through the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.
